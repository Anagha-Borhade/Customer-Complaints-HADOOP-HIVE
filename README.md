Analyzing Consumer Complaints Dataset using HIVE

The American Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sends thousands of consumers’ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response.
<br>It is very important to rely on a mechanism that helps the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) division in each company to analyse and handle complaints.

The data that we are using pertains to the complaints received by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection about financial products and services from 2012-2016.
Our dataset consists of 6,70,598 rows and 18 columns in the Comma Separated Values (.CSV) file format. We have worked on a subset of 50 rows due to computational restrictions. 
<br>
<br> You can find the dataset here : https://data.world/data-society/consumer-complaint-data

It includes complaint information as follows:
Date
Product
Company
Complaint description
State
Complaint Method
Response from company and whether it's timely
